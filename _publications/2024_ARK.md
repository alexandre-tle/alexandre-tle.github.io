title: "On a Software Joint Velocity Limitation of a Spherical Parallel Manipulator with Coaxial Input Shafts"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2015-10-01-paper-title-number-3
excerpt: 'This article discusses the implementation of a software joint velocity limitation dedicated to a Spherical Parallel Manipulator (SPM) with coaxial input shafts (CoSPM) using a speed control loop. Such an algorithm takes as input the current joint positions as well as the joint reference velocities computed by the speed controller and limit the latter in order to avoid any known singular configuration. This limitation takes into account the workspace properties of the mechanism and the physical characteristics of its actuators. In particular, one takes advantage of the coaxiality of the input shafts of the CoSPM and the resulting unlimitted bearing.'
