excerpt: 'This article dives into the use of a 3-RRR Spherical Parallel Manipulator (SPM) for the purpose of inertial Line Of Sight (LOS) stabilization. Such a parallel robot provides three Degrees of Freedom (DOF) in orientation and is studied from the kinematic point of view. In particular, one guarantees that the singular loci (with the resulting numerical instabilitiesand inappropriate behavior of the mechanism) are far away from the prescribed workspace. Once the kinematics of the device is certified, a control strategy needs to be implemented in order to stabilize the LOS through the upper platform of the mechanism. Such a work is done with MATLAB Simulink® using a SimMechanics™ model of our robot.'
